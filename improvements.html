<h1>Imrovement's to my code</h1>

<p>One thing that I added to my code was a better bar grpah. In my developing ideas, I envisioned just a small red bar to symbolize how many deaths there were, but instead I got a really good looking graph that clearly represented my data. However, due to time constraits as well as difficulty, I was unable to load in some fun facts for every single country. In my developing Ideas, I was looking to load one fun fact for every country due to HIV and AIDS. For example, if the user chose "Afghanistan" in the dropdown, something like, " Illiteracy presents a barrier to HIV awareness and prevention. The literacy rate in the general population is very low (26 percent) and lowest among women (12 percent) with little awareness about HIV and AIDS and almost no condom use." Would pop up onto the screen. However, I focused more on the graph because I figured that if people were coming to my website, they would most likely be coming for the data, and not extra fun facts. Also, for my JSON data, a lot of my countries had "No Data" on it, so when the user tries to find a a country such as "Afghanistan" (Which has no data on it), there will be an alert that says (No Data). This is a good alert, but when a user gets so many alerts of such things, it can get annoying and does runs the user experience. In my developing ideas page, I wanted to fit a lot on my page and so I squished everything very close together. The reason I didn't do this was for a few reasons
<br>
<br>
1. It would be very cramped and filled with useless information
<br>
2. It would be hard to generate all this new data for every single country
<br>
3.Some countries such as Yemen or Isle of man could have less information, but I want all the information in each country to be balanced.

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
One thing that I missed that I had called for in my developing ideas is a few more backround information graphs. Like I previously mentioned, I didn't want my page to be filled with useless information. Instead, I could use some background information graphs. For example, If I was talking about AIDS and HIV in France, I could have a supporting pie chart stating what causes the AIDS and HIV.
