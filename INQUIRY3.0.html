<h2>What is the problem?</h2>
<p>HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus and is a virus that can lead to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS. Although you can live with HIV and AIDS, like cancer, there is no cure yet. However, there are still multiple deaths in many countries. For example, in 2005, there were close to 5 million HIV infections and 3 million deaths due to aids. Under developed countries such as Lesotho and other countires in south africa suffer heavily from HIV and AIDS.</p>

<h2>Research Plan</h2>

<p>Firstly, we need to recognize that finding a cure for HIV and AIDS at this point in time is hard. However, we can find the cause and effect of this which can also lead to more scientific research, ultimately finding a cure for HIV and eventually aids. Firstly, we must start with the cause and the effect of HIV. The cause of HIV  can be many things. It can be spread by contact with infected blood or from mother to child during pregnancy, chilbirth or breast feeding. Without medication, it may take years before HIV weakens your immune system. After this, you will get AIDS. Aids is a chronic, potentially life threatening disease that kids and adults do NOT want to have. </p>

<p>After finding the cause and effect, we need to find out the countries most effected by HIV and AIDS. Obviously countires such as Lesotho and other under-devloped countries are the ones that will have the most people affected by HIV and AIDS.</p>

<p>After finding the countries with the most PERCENTAGE (some small countries with a small population could have a high percentage of people affected by HIV and AIDS) of people affected by HIV and AIDS. After this, we can study what they do in their everyday lives, who they generally interact wiht, as well as their birth proccess. We can compare these statistics to one of the more healthy countries.</p>

<h3>Spreading Awareness</h3>

<p>In terms of spreading awareness, there are many things that we can do. The first thing is to research how to make a webpage. In order to do this, we need to know 5 skills,</p>

<p>
	1. Research how to convert .json data into more usable data using HTML.
	<br>
	2. Learn CSS, HTML, and Java. With these, you can spread awareness of the problem. You can decorate and write things on your website such as ways to detect if someone has HIV, or what to do if it looks like someone has HIV.
	<br>
	3. Research how to create graphs, canvases, and many other things using HTML and CSS through credible websites such as w3schools and stackoverflow.
	<br>
	4. Add search bar as well as shortcuts to delete and to make navigating easier. 
</p>






<h2>Inspiration Range of Existing Products</h2>


<h3>1. <a href="http://population.io/">Population.io</a></h3>
<br>
<p>Population.io is a great website that utilizes CSS as well as JavaScript to make a professional website whilst using cool gif's and animations as well as aesthetics including colour. This website also spreads awareness in a different way then we would expect</p>
<br>
<h3>2. <a href="https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv-aids/fact-sheets/19/45/hiv-aids--the-basics">HIV and AIDS: The basics</a></h3>
<br>
<p>This website is another website that is aesthetically great. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, and it also provided me with a lot of information on HIV and AIDS.
</p>
<br>
<h3>3. <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/17131.php">Medical News today: HIV and AIDS</a></h3>
<br>
<p>When visiting this website, it was clear to me that the creator wanted to take a light and clear approach to it. As you can see, most of the website is in light colours, including white and light blue. It is another website that I enjoyed reading. It also shed some light on how HIV can progress to AIDS..</p>

<h2>Design Brief</h2>

<p>
	1. Must have an easily accessible search bar which will allow the user to find the country or place that the user is trying to find 
	<br>
	2. Must have data shown in the form of graphs instead of in Json data.
	<br>
	3. Must use CSS and JavaScript to make it look visually pleasing
	<br>
	4. There must be many moving pictures as well as many other canvas's to make the user want to be on the page and look deeper into it.
	<br>
	5. A frequently asked question button where some questions that are asked frequently will be answered
